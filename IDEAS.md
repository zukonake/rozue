# Rozue ideas
### General
* goal is to reach top of the map
### Map
* infinite 3d map
* map is grid based
* whole map is filled with dungeons
* ancient mayan inspired dungeons
    * some are active with no wines
        * filled with monsters, guardians and traps
        * high-value treasure/gear/materials inside
    * the rest is like a wilderness
        * filled with animals and "plants"
    * there are different zones or "biomes" of dungeons
        * they are procedurally generated
        * generated monsters and items
        * different levels and rewards
        * zones have random names
            * maybe like in dwarf fortress?
    * random plague in rooms
    * the plague takes over nearby open rooms slowly
    * the plague is dark, it eats all light
    * the plague grows much quicker in darkness
    * the plague can be fought with, but its quite slow
    * the plague turns entities into a dark, fast and aggressive version
        * dark entities will have a negative effect on light
* occasional towns and caverns
* some source of light exists but its mostly dark
### Mechanics
* food water and light are neccesary to survive
    * survival shouldnt be a hard to sustain
    * survival shouldnt limit the player
* player is free to build and rearrange the dungeons
* dynamic combat system
* weapons are hotline miami-like
    * ofc no guns
        * okay maybe a little
* game assets loadable with lua or other language
* physics engine
* entities move freely or on a smaller grid
* entities can fall down
### Graphics
* the view is top down
* you can see levels below, darker or something
* extensive light system
* extensive field of vision system
* minimap showing the dungeon zones
